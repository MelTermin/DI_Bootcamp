for forms in React

add name in the input also is the same in the state in the instructor

this.state {
  fname:"",
  lname:""
}


<input name="lname" onChange= {this.handleChange}>

handleChange= (e) => {
  this.setsTATE({[e.target.name]:e.target.value})
}


redux is state management;
instead of getting it from this.state => you will get it from props


reducer is changing the state of the store

action (is the dispatch is like a function ?)- reducer(this is returning new data) - store(puts the new data in the store)


we can use redux for angular, javascript and other programing langugages
to connet react to redux;
